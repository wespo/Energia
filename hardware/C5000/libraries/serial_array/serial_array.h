/** \file

  This library extends the capabilities of the Energia Serial
  library to send and receive arrays of arbitrary length.
  A command/data class is also defined to manage the sending 
  of integer commands and data over the serial interface.
  
  Usage for array send/receive:
  - Initialize the serial interface
    - DSP Shield: serial_connect()
    - Matlab: [s, connected] = serial_connect(comport, baud);
  - Send data
    - DSP Shield: serial_send_array()
    - Matlab: output = serial_recv_array(s);
  - Receive data
    - DSP Shield: serial_recv_array()
    - Matlab: serial_send_array(s, input);
  - Close communication
    - DSP Shield: do nothing.
    - Matlab: fclose(s);
    Note that if at any time during the communication the
    program encounters an error, the serial buffers between
    the DSP Shield and Matlab might get out of sync preventing
    subsequent communication.  In this case, you should
    manually close the Matlab serial port object by invoking
    the “fclose(s)” command on the Matlab prompt and restarting
    the DSP Shield.
  
  Usage to receive command/data pairs:
  - Initialize the serial interface
    - DSP Shield: serial_connect()
    - Matlab: [s, connected] = serial_connect(comport, baud);
  - Instantiate the SerialCmd class
    - DSP Shield: SerialCmd cmd;
  - Receive command
    - Matlab: serial_cmd(s, cmd, data);
    - SerialCmd::recv();
  - Extract command and data    
    - command = SerialCmd::getCmd();
    - data = SerialCmd::getDataIntPointer();
    
  For more information see documentation for the corresponding functions.

/** \brief Class to manage reception of commands from the serial interface

  The class creates an internal buffer as an array of type int.
  The data buffer array size must be as large as the maximum array length
  that you expect to receive.
  
  Usage:
  1. Create a SerialCmd instance with the default buffer length:
      SerialCmd cmd();
    or specify the maximum buffer lenght:
      SerialCmd cmd(MAX_BUFFER_LENGTH);
  2. Stablish a serial connection to Matlab with a specific baud rate:
      serial_connect(BAUD_RATE);
  3. When you are ready to receive a command, call the SerialCmd::recv function
      cmd.recv();
    This is a blocking command and it will wait indefinetely.
  4. You can retrieve the command, data array pointer and data array length,
    with the corresponding accessors:
      int command = cmd.getCmd();
      const int*  dataIntPtr  = cmd.getDataIntPointer();
      const long* dataLomgPtr = cmd.getDataLongPointer();
      int dataIntLength  = getDataIntLength();
      int dataLongLength = getDataIntLength();
